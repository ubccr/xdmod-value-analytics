Value Analytics is an optional module for **[Open XDMoD 7.5](https://open.xdmod.org/7.5/)**
for collecting, processing, and displaying financial and other value-related metrics.

## Current Status

The Value Analytics module is beta software. We *strongly* suggest using a separate, testing-only
instance of Open XDMoD for beta testing this module. This will avoid any risks to your production
instance of Open XDMoD.

This work was sponsored by NSF under grant numbers OAC 1566393, ACI 1025159, and ACI 1445806.
