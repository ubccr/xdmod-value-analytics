Value Analytics is an optional module for Open XDMoD for collecting, processing,
and displaying financial and other value-related metrics.

## Current Status

The Value Analytics module is currently in closed beta. The links to the GitHub
repository on this site will only work for participants who are logged into
authorized GitHub accounts.

**IMPORTANT**: We *strongly* suggest using a separate, testing-only instance of
Open XDMoD for beta testing this module. This will avoid any risks to your
production instance of Open XDMoD.

If you are interested in participating in the beta, please contact
`ccr-xdmod-help` at `buffalo.edu` for more information.
