This guide will outline how to install the Value Analytics module for Open
XDMoD.

The Value Analytics module is beta software. We *strongly* suggest using a separate, testing-only
instance of Open XDMoD for beta testing this module. **IMPORTANT**: If you have a previous version
of the Value Analytics module installed, then follow the instructions in the [Upgrade
Guide](upgrade.html).

RPM Installation
----------------

Suggested for installing Open XDMoD on Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, or any
other Linux distribution that supports RPM packages.
