This guide will outline how to install the Value Analytics module for Open
XDMoD.

**IMPORTANT**: We *strongly* advise against using a production Open XDMoD
instance for beta testing this module. Please conduct the beta test of
Value Analytics using a separate Open XDMoD instance dedicated to the beta test.
This will avoid risking unwanted changes to your production instance of
Open XDMoD.

If you have a previous version of the Value Analytics module installed, then
follow the instructions in the [Upgrade Guide](upgrade.html).

RPM Installation
----------------

Suggested for installing Open XDMoD on Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, or any
other Linux distribution that supports RPM packages.
